       " 'docs': [Document(page_content='**Patrick Mahomes (QB – KC)| Panic Meter: 3 **\\n\\nSooner or later the Chiefs have to figure it out, right? We’ve been asking\\nourselves this question for 8 weeks now and nothing has changed. In week 16,\\nMahomes finished with less than 17 points for the seventh time in his last\\neight games. He is QB10 on the season. No QB will offer you the same upside as\\nMahomes, but there are several likely-available players that have displayed a\\nmuch higher floor as of late. Consider these options:\\n\\n  * Baker Mayfield\\n\\n(QB – TB): averaging 22.9 PPG over his last three games.\\n\\n  * Joe Flacco\\n\\n(QB – CLE): averaging 351 pass YPG and 20.6 PPG over his last three games.\\n\\n**Austin Ekeler (RB – LAC) | Panic Meter: 3**', metadata={'source': 'https://www.fantasypros.com/2023/12/fantasy-football-panic-meter-patrick-mahomes-austin-ekeler-stefon-diggs-travis-etienne/'}),\n",
